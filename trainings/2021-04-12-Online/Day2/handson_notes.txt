Recreate the steps I showed you in the training. I've provided additional files you can play around with (together with sample solutions), or you can try to find solutions for your own data.

Hints:
For categorical data, some tools require one hot encoding.
In the Galaxy tool "Replace Text on Data", you can split cells manually by placing tabs in the replacement text with "\t" (without the quotation marks).

For the bad gene names, I've simulated a common problem where Excel replaces the gene IDs for genes like SEPTIN9 with dates. Try to find a solution to keep the correct number while only replacing the rest!
